<!-- 
In JavaScript, a shallow copy creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, but only copies references to the original object's properties. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all properties, ensuring that the new object is entirely independent of the original. A shallow copy can be made using object.assign() or spread operator. In short a shallow copy copies only references to nested objects or arrays, changes to nested objects affect both copies.-->
